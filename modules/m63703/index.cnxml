  <para id="fs-idp2038352">Government spending covers a range of services provided by the national, provincial, and local governments. When the national government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year, it runs a <term>budget deficit</term>. Conversely, when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year, it runs a <term>budget surplus</term>. If government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a <term>balanced budget</term>. For example, the South African government - according to its National Treasury medium term estimates - has budgeted to spend R139 billion more than it expects to collect in taxes in the 2016/2017 financial year (South Africa. National Treasury: 2016). This deficit is estimated to be about 3.2% of anticipated GDP in the 2016/2017 financial year.</para><para id="fs-idm26837856">This section presents an overview of government spending in South Africa.</para><section id="fs-idm94759184">
<title>Total South African Government Spending</title><para id="eip-597">Government spending in South Africa averaged R304 455.29 million from 1960 until 2016, reaching an all time high of R632 428 million in the first quarter (3 months) of 2016 and a record low of R65 991 million in the first quarter of 1960 (South Africa Government debt: 2016). This is an increase of nearly ten times since 1960. South African national government expenditure surpassed R1 trillion in the 2012/13 fiscal year, nearly double the R567 billion spent in 2007/08 (Statistics South Africa: 2014). Clearly, government has become a more significant role player in the South African economy over time. However, comparing spending over time in nominal Rands is misleading because it does not take into account inflation or growth in population and the real economy. A more useful method of comparison is to examine government spending as a percent of GDP over time.</para><para id="eip-381">Figure 1 shows the level of national government final consumption spending from 1960 to 2015 as a share of GDP. This graphic emphasises government's growing role in South Africa's economy. Figure 2 highlights some major national budget items in terms of annual government consumption expenditure for selected years since 1994.   </para><para id="eip-519">The national budget highlights government's priorities and its agenda. Thus, as is evident from Figure 2, social upliftment and economic development are clearly important goals of government especially since 1994. This is evident from the fact that around 40% of annual budgeted government expenditure has consistently been reserved for education, healthcare and social protection (welfare grants and subsidies). It is interesting to note that expenditure on defence has declined significantly since the dawn of democracy in 1994. Also noteworthy are government's annual debt service costs (annual interest payments on the national debt) which constitute a significant budget item. This is due to a reduction in the national debt between 2000 and 2010. However, since then the national debt has again been creeping up as is evident from the increase in annual debt service costs since 2010.</para><code id="eip-505" display="block"><media id="x180" alt="govt spend">

<caption><term>Figure 2</term> Selected government expenditure as a percent of total budgeted government expenditure for selected years (Source: South African Reserve Bank: 2013) </caption></code><para id="eip-640">Each year, the government borrows funds from South African citizens and foreigners to cover its budget deficits. It does this by selling securities (Treasury bonds, notes, and bills)â€”in essence borrowing from the public and promising to repay with interest in the future. Figure 3 shows that, from 1982 to 2014 (with the exceptions of 1989 and 2006/2007), the South African government has run annual budget deficits, and thus borrowed funds, in almost every year. It had very small budget surpluses in 1989 and again in 2006 and in 2007 but has since returned to deficits (World Bank: 2016b). Budget deficits add to the national debt and so increase annual debt service costs.</para><code id="eip-201" display="block"><media id="x182" alt="defsurp">

Even so, this constitutes R147.7 billion Rands of interest alone which is due in 2016/2017 on total government debt of over two trillion Rands. </para><para id="eip-592">Such big figures make more sense when seen from another perspective. The national debt presently is  40% of the value of South Africa's expected GDP in 2016/2017 (National Debt of South Africa: 2016). Interest on this debt works out at R3,677.00 Rands per second. If this debt was split equally among all of South Africa's 54.5 million people, each person (men, women and children) would be in debt to the tune of R37,427. If the current national debt was converted to U.S. one dollar notes, you could wrap these notes end-to-end around the Earth 552 times with the amount of $1 notes that would be required to settle the debt! Alternatively, if you laid the $1 bills on top of each other they would make a pile 15,497 km high! South Africa's citizens expect a lot from their government, but more government means more cost for everyone.</para><code id="eip-107" display="block"><media id="x184" alt="debtman">

The difference between the deficit and the debt lies in the time frame. The government deficit (or surplus) refers to what happens with the national government budget each year. The government debt is accumulated over time; it is the sum of all past deficits and surpluses. If you borrow R10,000 per year for each of the four years of university or college, you might say that your annual deficit was R10,000, but your accumulated debt over the four years is R40,000.</para><para id="eip-806">Figure 5 summarizes total budgeted government spending for 2016/2017 according to functional category while Figure 6 offers a summary of government spending according to economic classification. By examining the different categories of budgeted government spending one can discern the different functions of government that require funding support in a typical market economy: allocation of resources, redistribution of income and economic stabilization. Total budgeted government expenditure for the 2016/2017 financial year was R1463.3 billion (South Africa. National Treasury: 2016). </para><code id="eip-380" display="block"><media id="x187" alt="class3">

<title>Provincial and Local Government Spending</title><para id="eip-404"><title>Provincial government</title>The division of tax revenue (to fund government spending) between national, provincial and local government is based on the powers and functions assigned to each level of government, as well as their ability to raise revenue (South Africa.

Provincial governments in South Africa are responsible for implementing nationally determined policies in education, health, social development, agriculture, roads and human settlements. Thus government's role of <term>allocating resources</term> to the equitable provision of <term>public goods and services</term> is evident not only at national level  but also at the provincial level.

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idm42473920">Fiscal policy is the set of policies that relate to national government spending, taxation, and borrowing. In recent decades, the level of South African national government spending and taxes, expressed as a share of GDP, has increased significantly since the 1960s but seems to have levelled off at around 20% of GDP. Traditionally significant South African national budget items include spending on education, health, social protection and on annual debt servicing. Together they account for about half of total budgeted government expenditure. When a government spends more than it collects in taxes, it is said to have a budget deficit. When a government collects more in taxes than it spends, it is said to have a budget surplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a balanced budget. The sum of all past deficits and surpluses make up the government debt.</para></section>

<solution id="fs-idp71832496">
<para id="fs-idm8331984">Yes, a nation can run budget deficits and see its debt/GDP ratio fall. In fact, this is not uncommon. If the deficit is small in a given year, than the addition to debt in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio will be relatively small, while the growth in GDP is larger, and so the debt/GDP ratio declines. It is also theoretically possible, although not likely, for a nation to have a budget surplus and see its debt/GDP ratio rise. Imagine the case of a nation with a small surplus, but in a recession year when the economy shrinks. It is possible that the decline in the nationâ€™s debt, in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio, would be proportionally less than the fall in the size of GDP, so the debt/GDP ratio would rise.</para></solution>
